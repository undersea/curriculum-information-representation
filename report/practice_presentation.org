** Question
   What needs to be done to create a tool to graphically aid in the
   design of programmes of study at a university and also allow for
   the planning of a students programme of study

** Approach
   + Programme template
   + Find paper prerequisites
   + Store this information
   + Provide a interface with which to use the data to plan a
     programme of study
** Results
   + Template cannot be gained from planning page of degree
   + Getting prerequisites from online data seems possible
   + Have not got to the point of storing any data
   + The interface is yet to be developed
** Next Steps
   + See about getting the programme authors to provide a template to use
   + Have the system use the actions of previous users to recommend papers
   + store this information in some sort of database
   + Develop a interface
