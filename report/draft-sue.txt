Hi Sue

My name is James Hurford and I'm doing 159.799 Research Report. My
supervisor is A/Prof Stephen Marsland.  My project is a tool for
helping with the planning of a degree programme for a student.  I
notice that a similar project is being done by your department. I have
been in contact with Graham Robinson about this, and I was wondering
if we could set up a meeting with you and Graham to discuss how we can help each other.

Both Stephen and I are available

Monday 

9-10am
or
2-3pm

We could meet in AH3.83.

If this does not suit, then maybe

Thursday
11am-12pm
or
2-3pm

Could you let me know if any of these times suit.


I look forward to the opportunity of meeting with you.
