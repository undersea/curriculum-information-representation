* Introduction


* Workload
** The Problem
Workload is a measure of how many virtual hours each staff member is
going to be doing for the coming year. The purpose of Workload is to
spread the workload as fairly among the staff.  It is a artificial
measurement, using a formula to determine a individuals hour based on
a set of predetermined metrics.

The task is to create a application to take in:

+ For each paper offered

+ For each person teaching this paper how much of the paper they
  are teaching.
  + who the global coordinator is
  + who the local coordinator is

+ The Admin roles for each of the members of staff and how much
  the admin roles are worth in Workload hours.
+ For each postgraduate student


It could also be used as a tool to indicate where resources are needed
the most, if a extra staff member is needed.
*** What it is that this application is replacing
Currently a Excel spreadsheet is being used to store the input data
and calculate and display the results.  The current solutions is to
complex and needs a easier method for inputting the data.  The amount
of data inputted is coming near to the limit of how much Excel can
take.
*** How can a application be more flexible than the spreadsheet solution


*** How to represent it to users?
What form will this take?  What sort of format will be used?
** Challenges
*** What methods of development do I use?
*** What programming platform do I use?
*** Where is it going to be deployed?
*** Security
*** How to represent it to users
*** Where do I get my data from and how do I store it
*** What functionality do I implement
*** Responsiveness of application
** Solutions
*** Method of development
*** Deploying the application
*** Security
*** Framework choice
*** Database and importing of data
*** Feature choice
*** Code optimisation
