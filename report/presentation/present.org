    - Is complicated and hard to use.
    - Time consuming to collate data.
    - The amount of data stored is coming to the maximum.

* Access, Concurrency and Security

** 3 types of users
 + Administrator
 + Cluster leader
 + Ordinary Staff
** How concurrency issues were avoided
 + Cluster Copy
 + Administrator control
 + Otherwise not critical
** How important is security?
 + Password access
 + No secrets between staff
 + Write access
* Student Programme Planner

** What does Student Programme Planner do?

*** A tool to aid the planning and selecting of a degree.

*** Give the student a narrowed down choice of sets of papers for each degree.

* Scenario.
*** A Student does their first year of study at university.
*** Have not decided upon a major yet.
*** Want to know what their options are.
*** Want to know what major suits their choice of papers the best.
*** Want to know the possible paper combinations.
**** These combinations must be valid for the choice of degree.
**** Must allow them to complete their degree if done.

* Ideas on the user interface
** Multistory floor plan.
** Atom view.
** Line graph.
** Jigsaw puzzle.
** Self Organising map.


* What was the planned process?
