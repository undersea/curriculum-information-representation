#+TITLE: Managing staff
#+AUTHOR: James Hurford


* Introduction
** My project involves two projects
*** *Workload*
A Web based application for managing academic staff
*** *Student Programme Planner*
An application to aid in the planning of a students programme of study
for their entire degree.  This only covers the papers they may want to
take to achieve their degree.

* Workload
** Workload is
  + A measurement tool used to monitor staff workloads
** What are workload hours?
  + A way of approximating the fairness of a individual staff member,
    cluster group and all SEAT staff.
    - 1900 workload hours each
      + Teaching Allocations
      + Coordination of papers
      + Supervision of postgraduates
      + Administration roles

  + Management tool to aid in the distribution of work over the whole
    of SEAT.

  + It is a abstract measurement not meant to represent actual hours

* Original idea

* Current workload tool


** Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet application
#+begin_html
<div class="large">
#+end_html
  [[./spreadsheet.png]]
#+begin_html
</div>
#+end_html
    - Is complicated and hard to use
    - Time consuming to collate data
    - The amount of data it can store is coming to the maximum Excel
      can take
* The new Workload Application

** Open source

** Configurable

** Responsive

** Web application
*** Client side
**** jQuery
**** Ajax
**** HTML
**** CSS

*** Server side
**** Python
**** Django
**** MySQL
**** Microsoft Access

* Concurrency and Security

** 3 types of users

** How concurrency issues were avoided

** How important is it?

* Reflections

** Django

*** MTV view

**** Places structure on your application

*** Models

**** Allow you to develop database tables independent of specific DB

**** Easier to create tables

*** In general

**** Saves time and energy for most basic tasks
**** Documentation is still lacking in some areas

* Reflections
** W3C standards

*** Reduces incompatibility problems
*** Doesn't eliminate all problems

** jQuery

*** Eliminates most Javascript browser incompatibilities

*** Simplifies process of creating web application

* Reflections

** Javascript

*** Need to test on multiple browsers

**** Debugging tools across all platforms desirable

*** Internet Explorer and Webkit based browsers

**** Very strict on what they will accept

*** Firefox

**** Is very forgiving

** CSS

*** A must in modern web applications
*** Can't alter form controls of Firefox

* Reflections

** Response optimisation

*** Look at algorithm first

   - Only optimise inner most loop
   - Use as few calls and checks as possible
   - Use intrinsic operations like map() to simulate loops
   - avoid using functions written in python in inner most loop
   - use local variables
     - faster than using global
     - copy global to local if needed
   - use map(), filter() or reduce() to replace loops
     - only if using built-in functions
     - use a loop with in-line code otherwise


*** Look at C code if that fails

* Reflections

** Workload hours process

*** Formulas need clarification

*** Process needs documenting

** Database

*** Postgraduate database

**** Needs cleaning up

*** Local DB Data input

**** Setup of DB needs improvement

* Student Programme Planner

** What does Student Programme Planner do?

*** A tool to aid the planning and selecting of a degree programme

*** Give the student a narrowed down choice of sets of papers for each degree

* Use case
*** A Student does their first year of study at university.
*** They pass a number of papers.
*** They have not decided upon a major yet
*** They want to know what their options are.
*** They want to know what major suits their choice of papers so far the best
*** What are the possible paper combinations
*** These combinations must be valid for the choice of degree
*** Must allow them to complete their degree if done.

* Ideas on the user interface
** Multi story floor plan
** Atom view
** Line graph
** Jigsaw puzzle
** Self Organising map
** Templates

* Flowchart
