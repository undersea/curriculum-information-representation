Hi Graham

My names is James Hurford.  I am enrolled in 159.799 Research Report.  My supervisor is A/Prof Stephen Marsland.

The project I am doing for this paper is on creating a programme planner/assistant.  I understand you are in charge of a team which has spent the last 18 months developing something similar.

I was hoping you could help me.


Are the following available in machine-readable form?

Degree structure:
  - majoring requirements for each degree (BA/BSc/BInfc/BE ...)
 
Subject-specific majoring requirements
  - majoring requirements for Computer Science, Maths ...

Paper-specific details
  - no. of credits
  - prerequisites
  - corequisites
  - restrictions


If so can I possible get a copy of this?


I would be grateful for any help you could give me.

There are two ways of constructing a software design: one way is to
make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies; the other is
to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
