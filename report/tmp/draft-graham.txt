Hi Graham

I wrote to you before regarding my project, a Degree/Programme
planner.  I was wondering if we could set up a meeting with you and
Sue Pond to discuss how we can help each other.  I am contacting her as well. 

Both Stephen and I are available

Monday 

9-10am
or
2-3pm

We could meet in AH3.83.

If this does not suit, then maybe

Thursday
11am-12pm
or
2-3pm
